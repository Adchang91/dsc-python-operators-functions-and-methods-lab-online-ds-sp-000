After all that, there's nothing we can't compare. Well, I guess apples and oranges might still be off the table. We practiced using comparison, logical, and identity operators in Python to compare elements of the same and different datatypes and/or values. Going forward, there will be plenty of instances where we will need to compare elements. So, it is important to have a good understanding of how each of these operators works. Don't worry, as with all concepts in programming, the more we work with something the better we understand it.
